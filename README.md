# React/Redux List Example

A simple list built with React. Uses Redux for state/store management with a layer of Redux-ORM. Redux-Saga handles asynchronous events to prevent side-effects when handling the store.

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/wasafune/react-list-example.git
cd react-list-example
yarn install
yarn start
```

And thats it! A new window/tab should open on your browser.
