# React/Redux List Example

A simple list built with React. Uses Redux for state/store management with a layer of Redux-ORM. Redux-Saga handles asynchronous events to prevent side-effects when handling the store.

## Getting Started

`` yarn start ``

And thats it! A new window/tab should open on your browser.
